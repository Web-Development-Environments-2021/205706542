        About Eric
      </p>

      <p class="about-content">
        Eric Patrick Clapton (born 30 March 1945) is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time.
        After playing in a number of different local bands, Clapton joined the Yardbirds in 1963, replacing founding guitarist Top Topham. Dissatisfied with the change of the Yardbirds sound from blues rock to a more radio-friendly pop rock sound, Clapton left in 1965 to play with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, with whom he played on one album. After leaving Mayall in 1966, he formed the power trio Cream with drummer Ginger Baker and bassist Jack Bruce, in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and "arty, blues-based psychedelic pop". After Cream broke up, he formed blues rock band Blind Faith with Baker, Steve Winwood, and Ric Grech, recording one album and performing on one tour before they broke up, leading Clapton to embark on a solo career in 1970.
        Alongside his solo career, he also performed with Delaney & Bonnie and Derek and the Dominos, with whom he recorded "Layla", one of his signature songs. He continued to record a number of successful solo albums and songs over the next several decades, including a 1974 cover of Bob Marley's "I Shot the Sheriff" (which helped reggae reach a mass market), the country-infused Slowhand album (1977) and the pop rock of 1986's August. Following the death of his son Conor in 1991, Clapton's grief was expressed in the song "Tears in Heaven", which appeared on his Unplugged album, and in 1996 he had another top-40 hit with the R&B crossover "Change The World", and in 1998 released the Grammy award-winning "My Father's Eyes". Since 1999, he has recorded a number of traditional blues and blues rock albums and hosted the periodic Crossroads Guitar Festival. His most recent studio album is 2018's Happy Xmas.
        In 1998, Clapton, a recovering alcoholic and drug addict, founded the Crossroads Centre on Antigua, a medical facility for recovering substance abusers.

          Differences Between Web1, Web2 and Web3:
        </p>
      <div id="qna">
      <ul>
        <li>
          web1.0 is "read only" web. Users can recieve information but cannot update or change it.
        </li>
        <li>
          web2.0 is the dynamic web. Pages interact with users input and users can interact with each other.
        </li>
        <li>
          web3.0 introduced newer and more advenced technologies such as artificial intelligence, 3D graphics and specific content based on recommendation systems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <p style="font-family: Verdana; font-size: 24px;">
          <u>Let's explain those differences with an example: </u>
      </p>
      <p style="font-family: cursive; font-size: 22px;">
        Say a user wants to use the web to find a recipe for a birthday cake.
      </p>
      <div id="qna-example">
      <ul>
        <li><p style="font-size: 26px">
          In web 1.0 he will be able to find only results that the web masters have created. Websites containing recipes will not have the option of letting users add their own recipes, or comment on existing ones.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li><p style="font-size: 19px">
          In web 2.0 websites will have the options mentioned above. Pages would contain different recipes from different users, and recipes might be commented by other users reviewing their recipe.
          The user may also find blogs  about foods in general and maybe even specific on birthday cakes, and watch videos guiding the process of preparing the cake.
          The appearance of social networks in web 2.0 will allow the user to ask his friends for advice about making birthday cakes, and of course let them know about the upcoming party.
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          In web 3.0 the amount of data about birthday cakes is huge compared to web 1.0 and web 2.0. Therefore, search engines are much more efficient. They  retrieve information from all across the web indexing pages containing recipes and/or information and can match the best results to the data of the user searching for it.
